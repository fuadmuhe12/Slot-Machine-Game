# Slot Machine Game

Welcome to the Slot Machine Game project! This simple Java application simulates a slot machine where players can try their luck and win prizes.

## Overview

This project was developed during my summer break as part of my exploration into software engineering. It's a basic slot machine game implemented in Java, utilizing concepts such as random number generation, HashMaps, and basic user input.

## Features

- **One Draw:** Players can make a single draw by paying a fee and see the results.
- **Ten Draw:** For a higher fee, players can make ten draws consecutively and see the cumulative results.
- **Money Management:** The game includes features for cashing in, withdrawing money, and checking the current balance.

## How to Play

1. **Cash In:**
    - Enter the amount of money you want to deposit into the game.

2. **Play:**
    - Choose between making a single draw or ten draws.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions and observe the results.

3. **Withdraw Money:**
    - Check your current balance and choose to withdraw a specific amount.

4. **Balance:**
    - View your current balance at any time.

5. **Admin:**
    - Access admin features with a password.
    - View detailed statistics on player activity and outcomes.

6. **Exit:**
    - Exit the game.

## Statistics

The admin section provides statistics on player activity, including the number of one draw and ten draw plays, as well as the financial outcomes for players with 0, 1, and 2 similarities.

## Future Improvements

- Add more features to enhance gameplay.
